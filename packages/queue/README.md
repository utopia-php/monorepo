Utopia Queue is a powerful Queue library. This library is aiming to be as simple and easy to learn and use. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although this library is part of the [Utopia Framework](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project it is dependency free and can be used as standalone with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting started

Install using Composer:

```bash
composer require utopia-php/queue
```

Init in your application:

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';

// Create a worker using the Swoole adapter
use Utopia\Queue;
use Utopia\Queue\Message;

$connection = new Queue\Connection\Redis('redis');

if ($connection->ping()) {
    var_dump('Connection is ready.');
} else {
    var_dump('Connection is not ready.');
}

$adapter = new Queue\Adapter\Swoole($connection, 12, 'my-queue');
$server = new Queue\Server($adapter);

$server
    ->job()
    ->inject('message')
    ->action(function (Message $message) {
        var_dump($message);
    });

$server
    ->error()
    ->inject('error')
    ->action(function ($error) {
        echo $error->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
    });

$server
    ->workerStart()
    ->action(function () {
        echo "Worker Started" . PHP_EOL;
    });

$server->start();


// Enqueue messages to the worker using the Redis adapter
$connection = new Redis('redis', 6379);
$client = new Client('my-queue', $connection);

$client->enqueue([
    'type' => 'test_number',
    'value' => 123
]);
```

## Service levels

A queue can declare a target wait time, which the server publishes as the
`messaging.destination.sla` gauge alongside its wait-time histogram:

```php
$adapter = new Queue\Adapter\Swoole($connection, 12, 'my-queue', slaSeconds: 30);
```

Nothing in the library acts on the number. A message that waits longer than the
target is still delivered, and no timeout, rejection, or change of priority
follows from it. The target is there for whoever reads the telemetry, to compare
against the measured wait and decide what it means — page someone, escalate, or
add consumers.

It is published as a series rather than an attribute of the histogram so that a
single query can relate the two, since PromQL cannot do arithmetic with a label
value. A queue that declares no target publishes no gauge, which leaves a
reader able to tell an unclassified queue from one that has a target.

## System requirements

Utopia Framework requires PHP 8.0 or later. We recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.
